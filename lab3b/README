Included in the tarball are:
    README
    Makefile
    lab3b.py
    

lab3b.py: the lab file. It analyzes CSV and outputs inconsistencies. 

Makefile:
    default: creates lab3b executable
    dist: create the tarball with first UID
    clean: returns to untarred state



--- Remarks ---

The most difficult part, by far, was understanding the file system. It was rather interesting to find all the inconsistencies and potential errors.
