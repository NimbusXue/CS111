Included files:

lab0.c: a single C source module that put the keyboard into non-canonical input mode with no echo. It reads (ASCII) input from the keyboard into a buffer and write the received characters back out to the display. It also supports a --shell option, which utilizes Inter-Process Communication to read (ASCII) input from the keyboard, echo it to stdout, forward it to the shell, read input from the shell pipe and write it to stdout.

Makefile: a Makefile to build the program and the tarball. 
It supports the following command:
default: create the executable file lab1a 
clean: remove all the files created by the Makefile
dist: create the distribution tarball


README: a README file with identification information, a description of the included files and  testing methodology.

Testing methodology: uses both the sanity-check script and manual test with ./lab1a and ./lab1a --shell="/bin/bash" to check the appropriate results as expected.
